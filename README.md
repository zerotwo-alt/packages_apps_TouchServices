TouchServices is a system application designed to manage touch sampling rate settings and optimizations for supported devices. It allows users to control low-level kernel touch node parameters dynamically on a per-app basis to maximize responsiveness during gaming, while saving battery when high sampling rates are unnecessary.

## Features

- **Global Touch Sampling Control** - Instantly toggle high touch sampling rates globally.
- **Per-App Configuration** - Automatically enable high sampling rates only for selected applications (like games).
- **Background Service Manager** - Intelligent daemon that tracks the foreground application state with minimal overhead.
- **Quick Settings Tile** - Convenient toggle to apply or monitor touch sampling states from the status bar.

## Requirements

- Android 13 (API 33) or higher
- System-level permissions (privileged app)
- LineageOS or AOSP-based ROM
- Kernel with exposed touch sampling sysfs node

## Supported Devices

Currently, this package is explicitly configured and tested for the following devices:
* **Poco F6** (`peridot`)
* **Poco F5** (`marble`)

## Building & Installation


### Integration into Device Tree

To integrate this package into your custom ROM or Android source tree:

1. **Clone the repository** into your source tree under `packages/apps/`:
   ```bash
   git clone -b lineage-23.2 https://github.com/zerotwo-alt/packages_apps_TouchServices.git packages/apps/TouchServices
   ```

2. **Include the product makefile** in your device tree's `device.mk` or `common.mk` file:
   ```makefile
   # TouchServices
   $(call inherit-product, packages/apps/TouchServices/touchservice.mk)
   ```

3. **Build**:
   ```bash
   # Clean build
   m clean
   m Touchservice
   
   # Or build the entire ROM
   brunch <device>
   ```

## Porting to Other Devices

If you want to use TouchServices on a device other than those explicitly supported, you must properly configure the following elements to match your hardware's specific touch driver implementation:

1. **Touch Node Paths**: The application currently writes to `/sys/devices/virtual/touch/touch_dev/bump_sample_rate`. If your device uses a different sysfs path for touch sampling, update this within the application code (`src/com/android/touchservices/TouchSamplingUtils.kt`).
2. **SELinux Policies (`sepolicy`)**: You must thoroughly update `file_contexts` and `genfs_contexts` under `sepolicy/vendor` to properly label your device's specific sysfs nodes with `u:object_r:vendor_sysfs_touch:s0`. The app *will not open* or write successfully if it is denied by SELinux. Ensure `touchservice_app.te` maintains access.
3. **Init Script (`init.touchservice.rc`)**: Adjust the device-specific `init` script permissions to run the necessary `chown system system` and `chmod 0660` commands on your exact touch node path on boot.

## Troubleshooting

### App Not Opening or Force Closing
- Check if SELinux is actively denying the UI rendering or initialization: `adb logcat | grep avc`
- Ensure `touchservice_app` domain has proper `find` permissions for baseline Android services (like `surfaceflinger_service`) which might have been missed in device-specific or outdated sepolicy definitions.

### Settings not Applying
- Ensure your kernel actually supports the target sysfs path.
- Check node permissions: `adb shell ls -la /sys/devices/virtual/touch/touch_dev/bump_sample_rate`. It must be owned by `system` and have `0660` permissions.
- Validate values: Try manually echoing to the path via root shell:
  ```bash
  su
  echo 1 > /sys/devices/virtual/touch/touch_dev/bump_sample_rate
  ```
